# eCLM static file generator

This repository shows how to generate curvilinear surface and domain fields for eCLM simulations.
The generator follows the official CLM-workflow but makes a few adaptions.

It is not necessary to clone [CTSM](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM.git) and [cime](https://github.com/ESMCI/cime.git), as this generator is independent.
However, the basis is the CLM5.0 release and there might be newer developments in the official repositories.

By sourcing the provided environment file

```
source jsc.2024_Intel.sh
```

the necessary compilations in this repository can be performed consistently. It also contains the export of necessary paths for netCDF.

To create all static files needed to run eCLM, you first need to create a gridfile, then mapping and domain files and only then you can create surface and forcing files.
For this the grid has to be properly defined in one of the following formats:

- SCRIP
- ESMF-Mesh
- CF-convention-file

SCRIP is a very old format not maintained anymore but is still the most effective solution.
ESMF is able to basically handle any netCDF file that follows the CF-conventions version 1.6 and includes lat/lon values and corners.
This means that ESMF mesh files are also able to describe unstructured grids.

## Creation of gridfile

First, we need to create a gridfile that describes our simulation domain.
These come in two resolutions: ~12 km resolution (EUR-R13B05) and ~3 km resolution (EUR-R13B07).
Choose one of these two grids if you want to use this with TSMP2.
In this guide the default is EUR-R13B05, meaning that you will end up with all low-resolution static files on the icosahedral grid if you do not modify any of the following commands or scripts.
For other purposes guidelines for the *rectilinear* and *curvilinear* are here as well.
A curvilinear grid is normally used for CLM5, and when you run eCLM stand-alone you might choose to use a curvilinear grid as well.

The relevant scripts to create the grid files are in `./mkmapgrids/`.
The gridfile will contain arrays of longitudes and latitudes of the gridboxes' centres and corners.
The simulation domain is the EURO-CORDEX pan-European domain, which at high latitudes, for the Earth's canonical curvilinear grid, has significant convergence of the zonal dimension with increasing latitude.
Therefore we *rotate* the grid (of a same size) centred at the equator to the pan-European domain.

Grid files are available on the JSC machines in the DETECT CentralDB below `/p/largedata2/detectdata/CentralDB/projects/z04/detect_grid_specs/grids/`.
This is part of a Git repository that is also available [here](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/detect/detect_z03_z04/detect_grid_specification).

### Rectilinear grid

You can create a SCRIP file from a *rectilinear grid* with [`mkscrip_rect.py`](mkmapgrids/mkscrip_rect.py).
The Python packages numpy, xarray and dask-expr need to be available.
They are loaded by the [environment file](jsc.2024_Intel.sh) (sourced above).
The script was modified from `mesh_maker.py` from the CTSM repository to accept 2D lon / lat.
The main caveat is that the resulting surface files are in 1D which makes them harder to handle.
The python script `mkscrip_rect.py` can create SCRIP files including the calculation of corners.
It takes command line arguments like this:

```
./mkscrip_rect.py --ifile EUR-regLonLat01deg_1204x548_grid_inclbrz_v2.nc --ofile EUR-regLonLat01deg_659792_grid_SCRIP.nc --oformat SCRIP
```

`--help` provides additional information.

### Curvilinear grid

eCLM can be used with a *curvilinear grid*.

You can, e.g., use the 450x438 gridfile including boundary relaxation zone, `EUR-11_450x438_grid_inclbrz13gp_v2.nc`, as the input file.
If you want a high-resolution curvilinear grid, use `EUR-0275_1600x1552_grid_inclbrz_v2.nc`.
However, in eCLM we use a slightly smaller domain, so you must truncate the files:

```
cd mkmapgrids/
export CSMDATA="/p/largedata2/detectdata/CentralDB/projects/z04"
ncks -d rlat,3,434 -d rlon,3,446 $CSMDATA/detect_grid_specs/grids/EUR-11_450x438_grid_inclbrz13gp_v2.nc EUR-11_444x432_grid_inclbrz13gp_v2.nc
ncks -d rlat,3,1548 -d rlon,3,1596 /p/largedata2/detectdata/CentralDB/projects/z04/detect_grid_specs/grids/EUR-0275_1600x1552_grid_inclbrz_v2.nc EUR-0275_1594x1546_grid_inclbrz_v2.nc
```

At the moment SCRIP generation from *curvilinear grids* can be done and is tested to work with the NCAR Command Language (NCL), even though it is [deprecated](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/open_letter_to_ncl_users.shtml).
NCL can be installed through Conda.
If you have no Conda yet on your system, you can install it, including the conda-forge channel, following [this guide](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#unix-like-platforms-macos-linux--wsl).
Then follow [this guide](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic/portfolio/portfolio-9/#installing-ncl) to install NCL.
The repository contains the NCL-script [`mkscrip_curv.ncl`](mkmapgrids/mkscrip_curv.ncl) that can create a SCRIP file from a netCDF that contains the lat- and lon-center coordinates.
It is not necessary to provide the corners because the internal routine of NCL seems to calculate them correctly for the later steps.
Adapt the variable `f` in `mkscrip_curv.ncl` to your gridfile and execute:

```
ncl mkscrip_curv.ncl
```

### Icosahedral grid

The atmospheric model  ICON runs on an *icosahedral grid*, sometimes called *triangular grid*.
The land model eCLM, when coupled to ICON (in TSMP2), also uses this grid.

Check out https://zonda.ethz.ch/ for generating icosahedral input grids for `mkscrip_icos.py` (specified under option `--ifile`).

Then convert your ICON gridfile to the SCRIP format with the python script [`mkscrip_icos.py`](mkmapgrids/mkscrip_icos.py):

```
./mkscrip_icos.py --ifile EUR-R13B05_199920_grid_inclbrz_v2.nc --ofile EUR-R13B05_199920_grid_SCRIP.nc
```

For [TSMP2](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP2), on a 0.11 degree (~12 km) resolution, you probably want to use the EUR-R13B05 grid including boundary relaxation zone, `EUR-R13B05_199920_grid_inclbrz_v2.nc`, as the input file.
If you want a high-resolution icosahedral grid, use `EUR-R13B07_2473796_grid_inclbrz_v1.nc`.

Further information about the DETECT grid specification can be found [here](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/detect/detect_z03_z04/detect_grid_specification).

## Creation of mapping files

For the creation of the mapping files of CLM inputdata to our grid use `mkmapdata/runscript_mkmapdata.sh`.
Adjust the Slurm directives to your compute time project and partition.
Below the Slurm directives, modify `GRIDNAME` and `GRIDFILE` to your grid and previously created SCRIP file.
The script can be used on JURECA and JUWELS but it is advisable to use the large memory partitions for larger domains.
If you don't have access to the CLM mappingdata you have to download it.
Use:

```
wget --no-check-certificate -i clm_mappingfiles.txt
```
Then start the creation of the weights with
```
sbatch runscript_mkmapdata.sh
```

This will create regridding and netCDF mapping files in the current directory.

### Icosahedral grid

Experience has shown that conservative remapping does not always work for icosahedral grids (EUR-R13B05 and EUR-R13B07).
In that case `runscript_mkmapdata.sh` decides to create a mapping file that bilinearly interpolates fields.

## Creation of domain files

The CIME submodule under `./gen_domain_files/` generates the domain files for CLM.
This repository contains a simplified version of `gen_domain` which is easier to compile on [JSC](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc) machines and you do not need the CIME repository.
Required modules are imkl, netCDF and netCDF-Fortran (all provided by `jsc.2024_Intel.sh`).
Then compile `src/gen_domain.F90` with

```
gfortran -o gen_domain src/gen_domain.F90 -mkl -I${INC_NETCDF} -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
```

After the compilation you can execute `gen_domain` with $MAPFILE being one of the mapping files created in the step before (in `mkmapdata/`) and $GRIDNAME being a string with the name of your grid, e.g. `EUR-R13B05` for the ~12-km icosahedral grid.
The choice of $MAPFILE does not influence the lat- and longitude values in the domain file but can influence the land/sea mask.

```
./gen_domain -m $MAPFILE -o $GRIDNAME -l $GRIDNAME -u $USER
```

The created domain file will later be modified.

## Creation of surface file

The surface creation tool is found under `./mksurfdata/`.
You have to compile it with gmake in src-directory.
The required modules Intel and netCDF-Fortran are loaded by `jsc.2024_Intel.sh`.

After compilation execute

```
export GRIDNAME="EUR-R13B05"    # in case of the low-resolution icosahedral grid
export CDATE="`date +%y%m%d`"   # should match mapping files creation date
export CSMDATA="/p/largedata2/detectdata/CentralDB/projects/z04"

# generate surfdata
./mksurfdata.pl -r usrspec -usr_gname $GRIDNAME -usr_gdate $CDATE -l $CSMDATA -allownofile -y 2005 -hirespft
```

to create a real domain with hires pft.
Again, you need to have set $GRIDNAME, the date $CDATE in yymmdd format (matching the mapping files) and the path $CSMDATA where the raw data of CLM is stored.
You have to download the data from https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/lnd/clm2/rawdata/ if you have no access to JSC machines.
Also make sure that mksurfdata and mkmapdata have the same parent directory.

At least in the original UCAR rawdata input files, not all variables are available (as the correct name).
Instead you can create the surface file with *mostly* constant values (apparently `SOIL_COLOR` is not homogeneous) with the following command.
In a later step we are anyway going to replace variables in this file that are specific for eCLM (TSMP2).

```
./mksurfdata.pl -r usrspec -usr_gname $GRIDNAME -usr_gdate $CDATE -l $CSMDATA -allownofile -y 2005 -hirespft -usr_mapdir="../mkmapdata/" -no-crop -pft_idx 13 -pft_frc 100 -soil_cly 60 -soil_col 10 -soil_fmx 0.5 -soil_snd 40
```

PS: There are many versions mksurfdata.pl in the CTSM github. Stick to the CLM5-release version!
Other versions use other mapping files and are not compatible with negative longitudes.

## Modification of the surface and domain file

The created surface and domain file have negative longitudes that CLM5 does not accept and inherently has no landmask. To modify the longitudes and to add a landmask use `mod_domain.sh` after inserting the paths to your files.

## Creation of forcing data from ERA5

A possible source of atmospheric forcing for CLM5 is ERA5.
The folder `mkforcing/` contains two scripts that assist the ERA5 retrieval.
- `download_ERA5.py` contains a prepared retrieval for the cdsapi python module.
By modifying the two loops inside the script it is possible to download ERA5 for any timerange.
However, the script requires that cdsapi is installed with an user specific key.
More information about the installation can be found [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to).
- `prepare_ERA5.sh` prepares ERA5 as an input by changing names and modifying units.
ERA5 has to be regridded to your resolution before the script can be used.

`download_ERA5_v2.py`, `prepare_ERA5_v2.sh` and `extract_ERA5_meteocloud.sh` provide an alternative pathway. [This issue](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/HPSCTerrSys/tsmp-internal-development-tracking/-/issues/36) provides some details. Basically it is safer to extract the lowermost level of temperature, humidity and wind of ERA5 instead of taking 2m-values. The workflow goes like this:

```
bash extract_ERA5_meteocloud.sh
python download_ERA5_v2.py
regridding
bash prepare_ERA5_v2.sh
```

Note: This worfklow is not fully tested.
