# Replacement of CLM5 data with CLM3_5 data

The script `replace_clm5_with_clm3_5_data.sh` replaces variables in the CLM5 surfacedataset with data from CLM3_5 given that the data was produced accordingly, including explicit mapping of the urban landcover type and correct CLM5 soil levels.
The changed mapping for CLM3_5 can be found here:
